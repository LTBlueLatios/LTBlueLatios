Requires rewrite. 

For now, just know that I code in pure Vanilla JavaScript and reject the current fashion norm (ex: TypeScript, React, NextJS). I like designing my own systems instead of using magic black boxes. I integrate philosophy heavily into my projects, which can be seen in my project SoraJS.
