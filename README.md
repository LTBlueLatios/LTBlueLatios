Hey there! I'm BlueLatios, an advanced JavaScript programmer that codes in full-stack. I started coding in 2021 and enjoy working on self-made projects using Vanilla JavaScript (no TypeScript or frameworks here!).

My favourite programming paradigm is the Event Based Architecture.

I'm currently still learning all the intricacies of Javascript and what it has to offer!
