Hey there! I'm BlueLatios, an advanced JavaScript programmer that codes in full-stack. I started coding in 2021 and enjoy working on self-made projects using Vanilla JavaScript (no TypeScript or frameworks here!).

I program with a custom event-based architecture, of which I call MDR, that is designed with runtime safety, scalability, and consistency in mind.

I'm currently still learning all the intricacies of Javascript and what it has to offer!
