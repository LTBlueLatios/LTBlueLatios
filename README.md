# Hi There! I'm BlueLatios.


I am a programmer specialising in software engineering and systems design. I like to integrate bits of philosophy into the way I code. My main language is JavaScript/HTML/CSS, however, I can proficiently code in Kotlin and C (without the ++). I strive to keep my code maintainable, clean, and efficient. I love figuring out how to use basic building blocks to form a bigger picture. I have a few somewhat strong opinions that go against the fashion norm, such as preferring VanillaJS over TypeScript and despising the current state of JS frameworks (unnecessary pieces of abstraction). 

I like to work on mostly web-dev-related stuff; however, that doesn't exclude me from the realms of computer science. I've even gone so far as to actively enjoy manipulating memory and pointers in C programs! As for now, I'm learning the concepts of computer science while coding as a hobby.
